                <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h4>
                <li>This week i felt i have taken a huge jump in my knowledge. without going into to many specifics i found that a combination of proper pseudocode and incremental coding helps my development progress. being able to work out the logic of a small section of my projects then code that small portion eases the anxiety of looking at the project as a whole</li>
                <h4>What does it mean to develop good code?</h4>
                <li>It can mean a few things. however it mostly boils down to three main points. Your code needs to be readable/understandable. Your code needs to have simplicity. Your code needs to accomplish what it is intended to accomplish.
                </li>
                <h4>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h4>
                <li>This is also a question with a lot of intricate answers. It also goes hand-in-hand with the question above. a good developer needs to be able to write code that others can utilize. a good developer needs to be able to work in a team environment. a good developer needs to keep the end user in mind</li>
                <h4>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h4>
                <li>Myself personally? getting started. When looking at the entire scope of the project i can often get lost in what needs to be accomplished. by utilizing techniques i have mentioned above (proper pseudocode and incremental coding), i am learning to overcome the fear of getting started. once i am neck deep in the project i tend to enjoy myself. i love solving problems and working out logic</li>

                <h4>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h4>
                <li>There are two things that have held me back this week. The first is my lack of knowledge of proper syntax. I can work out problems logically but eventually I come to a point where I dont know how to write the code itself. With so many ways to solve the same problem I can end up lost in what I actually need to write out. The second issue is my lack of pseudocoding. While many students came together and work problems out on the white board, I didnt transfer that onto a document or piece of paper to refer back to later when our initial solutions did not work out.</li>
                <h4>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</h4>
                <li>I have been struggling with the design aspects. I would like to delve deeper into bootstrap so I can solve issues that arise when attempting to take my design and reproduce it on the page.</li>
                <h4>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>Significantly better so far. While I still struggle with getting all the required materials done, while in-person i just feel that my retention and skills are increasing exponentially. During remote I felt that while I could complete the assignments given, my understanding of the base material lacked.</li>
                <h4>What is your “Why”?</h4>
                <li>I have mostly worked labor and labor management positions throughout my life. I have found success in these industries, but would rather not be doing labor as I grow older. throughout my experience i had never experienced injury. on january 18th 2022 a pallet was dropped onto my hand, breaking my finger. This was the first time i had been injured in 10 years. after this injury, and with the convencing of another coworker, i came to the realization that i need to switch careers if i am going to be healthy and successful.</li>

                <h4>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h4>
                <li>a combination of the help channel in slack, the instructors being available to answer questions, and the structure of the assignments given out through google with accompanying slides to assist in understanding.</li>
                <h4>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>i do not work well by myself. in a purely online learning environment, i struggle with motivation and how to get started with an assignment. working online negatively effects my understanding and accomplishments of tasks assigned. the tools and information provided to us was significant, but i am an in person learner. i need hands on, in-person instruction to feel confident in the assignments and learning materials that are given</li>
                <h4>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>using a combination of google, the help channel, and collaboration between students has helped me overcome the challenges i have faced during onboarding. specifically being able to collaborate with other students has increased my confidence and understanding of the concepts and materials given so far.</li>

                <h4>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h4>
                <li>I believe the best way to answer this is using the house example. HTML is like the structure of the house. It gives the structure and definitions for the rest of the house to function. The CSS is like the design and paint. While not necessary to a websites function, it can make it usuable for an average user and keep the page contents organized. Javascript is like the electricity and plumbing. While everything else is useful and necessary the javascript is what makes the page run.</li>
                <h4>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h4>
                <li>So far nothing much. I currently have an image posted but i will update the blog as we progress!</li>
                <h4>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h4>
                <li>pseudocoding is a powerful tool that can help you break down a complicated problem without having to directly have an answer in the language you are using. It is a great and necessary first step when working on a coding project.</li>

                <h4>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h4>
                <li>I wish i had more speed and consistancy while coding. My long term goal is to look into and learn about webscraping</li>
                <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
                <li>keeping a more consistant schedule and learning the correct syntax for the languages we have worked with so far</li>
                <h4>How do you solve a problem?</h4>
                <li>i typically solve a problem by research and writing out the problem on paper or a white board. i enjoy delving into a topic until i can personally understand the problem at hand</li>
                <h4>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h4>
                <li>a combination of google and youtube during my research! i also have no trouble asking for help when needed!</li>

                <h4>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h4>
                <li>the first week was generally as expected. navigating github can be a little time consuming</li>
                <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
                <li>I am excited to get into javascript and less html and css. Specifically i am excited to begin learning React later on</li>
                <h4>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h4>
                <li>I love the outdoors, camping is one of my favorite activities. im interested in developing tools related to outdoor activities and outdoor gear pricing structures</li>
