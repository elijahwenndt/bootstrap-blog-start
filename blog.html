                <h4 class ="text-center">The beginnings of a technical article(How to refactor code from the perspective of a beginner)</h4>
                <p>Every programmer knows how to code. From someone in the middle of bootcamp, to the lowest jr developer, to the highest sr dev on the team. Good code is what fuels the industry. But how does one write good code? Often times the code a beginner writes is functional, but not production level. In this article i will attempt to explain how to refactor your code from the perspective of someone who is nearly a complete beginner.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Functional code is king</h5>
                <p>Before even beginning to speak about refactoring, we need to get one thing straight. Functional code is king. If there is a specific way that you <em>KNOW</em> how to solve a problem brought up in your project, then use that solution first. When you are taking part of a bootcamp, you are typically on a tight schedule. Sometimes you just need to get the logic or design working within a time crunch. In this case, it is better to have working code than no code. An instructor can guide you into how to refactor your code into a better, more succinct solution. As a student in a bootcamp especially, you will be on tight deadline to get a presentable project. Having a working project when it is time to present is much more important. After your personal demo day, thats when the refactoring can begin. </p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Begin Small</h5>
                <p>When beginning to refactor, you need to think small. often times there is obvious WET code within your project that you already know how to fix, just ran out of time before the deadline hit. Starting with something that you know how to fix is the best possible starting point you can have. I will give a simple example from my own code that was an easy fix, i just couldnt refactor it before the deadline. Using good, better, and best practices as a framework, this refactor is probably in the better catagory. While it still isnt perfect, it is better than the original code i produced.</p>
                <p>This was from a project where we built Tic-Tac-Toe. when setting up the eventListeners for the individual divs, I just threw them out in the open in order to set up all the 9 seperate divs with 'click' event listeners</p>
                <pre><code>
document.getElementById('0').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('1').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('2').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('3').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('4').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('5').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('6').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('7').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
document.getElementById('8').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
                </code></pre>
                <p>I used this method again when players wanted to reset the game (as well as some other examples of WET code that have also been refactored</p>
                <pre><code>
function resetButton () {
    gameState = [
        '', '', '',
        '', '', '',
        '','','']

    playerTurn = 0
    playerLetter = 'X'
    turnCount = 0
    document.getElementById('0').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('1').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('2').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('3').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('4').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('5').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('6').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('7').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById('8').innerHTML = ''
    document.getElementById("target").innerHTML='X starts first'
    document.getElementById('0').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('1').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('2').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('3').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('4').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('5').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('6').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('7').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    document.getElementById('8').addEventListener('click', playerMove)
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>First of all, this code does work. In the timeframe we had to complete this project, I <em>KNEW</em> that this solution would work. I understood loops and how they function, but i wanted to have a working product that I could get that i knew would not produce any bugs. This would more than likely be in the good catagory. Its not very pretty code, but it did what it needed to while i was testing.</p>
                <p>Next is how I changed it up. Once again, I already knew how to rewrite this block using loops and functions, so refactoring wasnt very time consuming, and it was the first objective I tackled.</p>
                <pre><code>
function addListeners () {
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        document.getElementById(i).addEventListener('click', playerMove)
    }
}
addListeners();

function removeListners () {
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        document.getElementById(i).removeEventListener('click', playerMove)
    }
}

function makeBlank () {
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    document.getElementById(i).innerHTML = ''
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>So i took the code I wrote earlier, and changed it into a more brief solution. The code is significantly dryer than it was before. I repeat myself less, while still outputting the same result. I took my initial solution, and made it <em>better</em>. Still may not be best, but I was able to take criticism given to me during our demonstrations, and utilize it to write better code. The culmination of this being that i can call these functions wherever i want, and they will accomplish the same task without having to repeat the same 9 lines of code over again. However, its good to note that these solutions both accomplish the same result. </p>

                <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h4>
                <li>This week i felt i have taken a huge jump in my knowledge. without going into to many specifics i found that a combination of proper pseudocode and incremental coding helps my development progress. being able to work out the logic of a small section of my projects then code that small portion eases the anxiety of looking at the project as a whole</li>
                <h4>What does it mean to develop good code?</h4>
                <li>It can mean a few things. however it mostly boils down to three main points. Your code needs to be readable/understandable. Your code needs to have simplicity. Your code needs to accomplish what it is intended to accomplish.
                </li>
                <h4>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h4>
                <li>This is also a question with a lot of intricate answers. It also goes hand-in-hand with the question above. a good developer needs to be able to write code that others can utilize. a good developer needs to be able to work in a team environment. a good developer needs to keep the end user in mind</li>
                <h4>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h4>
                <li>Myself personally? getting started. When looking at the entire scope of the project i can often get lost in what needs to be accomplished. by utilizing techniques i have mentioned above (proper pseudocode and incremental coding), i am learning to overcome the fear of getting started. once i am neck deep in the project i tend to enjoy myself. i love solving problems and working out logic</li>

                <h1 class ="text-center">9/25/22</h1>
                <h4>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h4>
                <li>There are two things that have held me back this week. The first is my lack of knowledge of proper syntax. I can work out problems logically but eventually I come to a point where I dont know how to write the code itself. With so many ways to solve the same problem I can end up lost in what I actually need to write out. The second issue is my lack of pseudocoding. While many students came together and work problems out on the white board, I didnt transfer that onto a document or piece of paper to refer back to later when our initial solutions did not work out.</li>
                <h4>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</h4>
                <li>I have been struggling with the design aspects. I would like to delve deeper into bootstrap so I can solve issues that arise when attempting to take my design and reproduce it on the page.</li>
                <h4>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>Significantly better so far. While I still struggle with getting all the required materials done, while in-person i just feel that my retention and skills are increasing exponentially. During remote I felt that while I could complete the assignments given, my understanding of the base material lacked.</li>
                <h4>What is your “Why”?</h4>
                <li>I have mostly worked labor and labor management positions throughout my life. I have found success in these industries, but would rather not be doing labor as I grow older. throughout my experience i had never experienced injury. on january 18th 2022 a pallet was dropped onto my hand, breaking my finger. This was the first time i had been injured in 10 years. after this injury, and with the convencing of another coworker, i came to the realization that i need to switch careers if i am going to be healthy and successful.</li>

                <h4>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h4>
                <li>a combination of the help channel in slack, the instructors being available to answer questions, and the structure of the assignments given out through google with accompanying slides to assist in understanding.</li>
                <h4>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>i do not work well by myself. in a purely online learning environment, i struggle with motivation and how to get started with an assignment. working online negatively effects my understanding and accomplishments of tasks assigned. the tools and information provided to us was significant, but i am an in person learner. i need hands on, in-person instruction to feel confident in the assignments and learning materials that are given</li>
                <h4>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h4>
                <li>using a combination of google, the help channel, and collaboration between students has helped me overcome the challenges i have faced during onboarding. specifically being able to collaborate with other students has increased my confidence and understanding of the concepts and materials given so far.</li>

                <h4>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h4>
                <li>I believe the best way to answer this is using the house example. HTML is like the structure of the house. It gives the structure and definitions for the rest of the house to function. The CSS is like the design and paint. While not necessary to a websites function, it can make it usuable for an average user and keep the page contents organized. Javascript is like the electricity and plumbing. While everything else is useful and necessary the javascript is what makes the page run.</li>
                <h4>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h4>
                <li>So far nothing much. I currently have an image posted but i will update the blog as we progress!</li>
                <h4>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h4>
                <li>pseudocoding is a powerful tool that can help you break down a complicated problem without having to directly have an answer in the language you are using. It is a great and necessary first step when working on a coding project.</li>

                <h4>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h4>
                <li>I wish i had more speed and consistancy while coding. My long term goal is to look into and learn about webscraping</li>
                <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
                <li>keeping a more consistant schedule and learning the correct syntax for the languages we have worked with so far</li>
                <h4>How do you solve a problem?</h4>
                <li>i typically solve a problem by research and writing out the problem on paper or a white board. i enjoy delving into a topic until i can personally understand the problem at hand</li>
                <h4>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h4>
                <li>a combination of google and youtube during my research! i also have no trouble asking for help when needed!</li>
